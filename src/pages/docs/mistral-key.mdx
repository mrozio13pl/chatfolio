# Using your own Mistral API key

<Callout>
    Chatfolio uses only single API key which is limited to __1 request per
    second__ by Mistral. If you find this to be problematic, consider using your
    own Mistral API key.
</Callout>

This key will be encrypted and stored in our database. You will not be asked for this key again and wonâ€™t be able to access it on your dashboard for security reasons. You can still remove it at any time and chatfolio's api key will be used as a fallback.

## Create a Mistral API key

[Create a Mistral API key](https://mistral.ai/docs/api-keys) and copy the key to your clipboard.

Paste the key in the [dashboard](/dashboard/mistral-key) and click **Save**.

## Reset the key

If you want to reset the key, make sure the input is empty and click **Reset**.
